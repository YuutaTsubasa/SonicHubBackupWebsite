[UPDATE]</span><br>Hopes shattered as Kuta perhaps not a filmmaker after all.<br>By: Svend Joscelyne, 24th January 2007 (11:54)<br><br>Sonique of Fans United for SatAM has spoken to Sonic News about the recent story of a possible Sonic movie in the works, stating that Richard Kuta\s chances of actually getting the project off the ground is slim.<br><br>\Richard Kuta is NOT a film maker. What films has he made? None. Nada, zero zip, zilch. He\&#x27;s just a guy who\&#x27;s been banned from almost every Sonic forum ever made who has a dream.

Sonique states that findings point to the group being makers of flash animations rather than a professional major movie production team.
